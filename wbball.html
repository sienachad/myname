       <font color="white" size="3">The Gonzaga Women's Basketball team has been dominating 
        the court this season, showcasing exceptional talent and teamwork. With a strong mix 
        of experienced upperclassmen and rising stars, the Zags have continued to make a 
        significant impact in the West Coast Conference and beyond. Their impressive record, 
        dynamic offense, and stifling defense have earned them national recognition and a spot 
        among the top teams in the country. As the season progresses, Gonzaga remains focused on 
        making a deep run in the postseason, with eyes set on adding another chapter to their 
        storied legacy.</font>
